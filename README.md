# Music Theory for Piano Music Transcription using Reinforcement Learning 

# ABSTRACT  
This project focuses on piano music transcription. We propose a novel method for transcribing polyphonic piano music into symbolic form by applying reinforcement learning (RL) with reward rules grounded in classical music theory. We process the .WAV file using Long Mel Spectrogram and feed it into CNN.
